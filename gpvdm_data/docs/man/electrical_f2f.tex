\subsubsection{Free-to-free carrier recombination}
A free-carrier-to-free-carrier recombination (bi-molecular) pathway is also included. However, most organic solar cells have a great deal of trap states and an ideality factor greater than 1.0 suggesting that free-to-free recombination is not the dominant mechanism.  Free-to-free recombination is described using equation \ref{equ:freetofree}

\begin{equation}
R_{free}=k_{r}(n_{f}p_{f}-n_{0}p_{0})
\label{equ:freetofree}
\end{equation}
