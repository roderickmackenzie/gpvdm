Use the power of device simulation to understand your experimental data from thin film devices such as Organic Solar cells, sensors, OFET, OLEDs, Perovskite solar cells, and many more. Unlike may other models gpvdm is purpose built from the ground up for simulating thin film devices made from disordered materials. Downloaded more than 25,000 times with over 200 papers published using the model, gpvdm has become one of they key device modelling tools used by the scientific community developing the next generation of opto-electronic devices.

This book written by the author of gpvdm explains will take you from a standing start to being able to confidently simulate your own devices. Learn how to simulate, Organic solar cells, Organic Field Effect Transistors, Perovskite solar cells, Organic LEDs, Large area printed devices
 and many more..
