\subsubsection{Geminate recombination - organics only}
There are a number of models to calculate the number of geminate pairs which get converted to free charge carriers (i.e. the Onsager-Braun model).  However, these models will generally require a number of parameters which are not reliably known. So although it's possible (and interesting) to write a model to simulate geminate recombination, one is usually better off simply introducing a photon efficiency factor by which the number of absorbed photons is multiplied. This factor can be obtained to a reasonable degree by comparing the difference between the simulated and experimental $J_{sc}$.  This parameter can set in the configuration section of the optical simulation window.
