\subsection{Installing gpvdm on Linux} \label{installing_on_linux}
The windows version of gpvdm seems to be much more popular than the Linux version.  Therefore, I will tend to publish an updated windows exe every couple of weeks (along with the platform independent source code) and only publish updated linux rpms/deb packages when someone asks me to.  This means that the Linux deb/rpm files tend to lag behind the windows version by about a year.  For this reason I recommend you install the Linux version from source.  If you don't want to do this, drop me an e-mail and I will often be able to push out a new rpm/deb within a day or two.  Currently I provide pre-compiled copies for, Fedora Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Debian Linux, Mint Linux , Opensuse Leap, and Raspbian pi 3.0.


\subsection{Linux from source the easy way}
Download the gpvdm by issuing the command

\begin{verbatim}
git clone  https://github.com/roderickmackenzie/gpvdm
\end{verbatim}
Find your operating system in

\begin{verbatim}
build_system/dependency_scripts
\end{verbatim}

This script should install all the packages you need to run/compile gpvdm for a given OS. I don't always keep them up to date, so if you have a new version of an OS and the packages have been renamed you may have to hunt around.

Then run:
\begin{verbatim}
./build
\end{verbatim}

Then select, (compile), and (auto). Then hit return to build.

\subsection{Linux from source the hard way}

On Fedora install the following pacakges:\newline
dnf install zlib-devel libzip-devel libmatheval-devel suitesparse-devel openssl-devel gsl-devel libcurl-devel blas-devel librsvg2-tools texlive ghostscript ImageMagick mencoder valgrind @development-tools fedora-packager mingw32-gcc python-crypto python-awake python3-qt5-devel python3-crypto python3-matplotlib-qt5 python3-openpyxl python3-pyopengl numpy notify-python python-inotify.noarch python-matplotlib python-inotify python-matplotlib indent unifdef indent libcurl-devel poedit ElectricFence kcachegrind help2man\newline
\newline
Then build the build system\newline
aclocal\newline
automake --add-missing\newline
automake\newline
autoconf\newline

Then configure the build system:\newline
./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/suitesparse/"\newline

Then make the binary\newline
make\newline
