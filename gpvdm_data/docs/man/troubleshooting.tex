\section{Why don't I get a 3D view of the device}

If your simulation window looks like figure \ref{fig:nothreed} and not like figure \ref{fig:threed}.  It means  either you do not have any 3D acceleration hardware on your computer, or you do not have the drivers for it installed.  If you have an ATI/Nvidia/Intel graphics card check that the drivers are installed.  Currently, not having working 3D hardware will not affect your ability to perform simulations. This is not a gpvdm bug it's a driver/hardware issue on your computer.
