\subsubsection{Equilibrium Shockley-Read-Hall recombination}

For some very ordered material systems where there are not many trap states it is enough to describe SRH trap states using the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ss_srh}
R^{SRH}=\frac{np-n_{0}*p_{0}}{\tau_{p} (n+n_{1})+\tau_{n} (p+p_{1})}
\end{equation}

 where $R_{SRH}$ is the rate of SRH recombination, $n,p$ are the density of free charge carriers $n_0, p_0$, are the equilibrium density of charge carriers, $\tau_{n,p}$ are the SRH life times and $n_{1}$ and $p_{1}$ are the trapped electron and hole densities when the Fermi-level matches the trap state energy.  This can be turned on in the electrical parameter editor.
