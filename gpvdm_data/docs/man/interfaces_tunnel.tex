\subsection{Tunnelling through heterojunctions}
Tunnelling of holes through hetrojunction interfaces are is give by
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{J_p} = q T_{h}  ((p_{1}-p_{1}^{eq})-(p_{0}-p_{0}^{eq})),
\end{equation}

and for electrons

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{J_n} = -q T_{e}  ((n_{1}-n_{1}^{eq})-(n_{0}-n_{0}^{eq})).
\end{equation}

Where $T_{h}$ and $T_{e}$ represent the rate constants of the tunnelling. This can be configured in the interfaces editor.
