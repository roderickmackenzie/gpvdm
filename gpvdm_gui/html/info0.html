<b>Feature requests/collaboration</b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:16pt"> 
If gpvdm can't do exactly what you want it to do, then I am in general happy to add code to make it solve your problem, ideally with the view to some type of joint publication.

<b>Why gpvdm?</b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:16pt"> 
In short: The world is facing an existential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">CO2/energy crisis</a>, as well as a growing population which needs medical care.  Thin film devices such as  OPVs/OLEDs/OFETs offer many answers to these problems.  I feel the more people who are studding these devices the better a chance we have of finding answers.

<b>The roadmap</b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:16pt"> 
<ul>
  <li>Improved perovskite models, which include ion diffusion.</li>
  <li>Improved OLED models: I have not used the OLED model my self, so I think there is a lot which could be added to it. Including far/near field calculations.</li>
  <li>The inclusion of thermal models.  There is a thermal model in the model but I have not really used it much.</li>
  <li>Integrated FDTD optical model.</li>
  <li>Better fitting with experimental data.</li>
  <li>Improved OFET models.  As with the OLED model, I have not used the OFET model my self so I expect there are a lot of features which could usefully be added to it.</li>
  <li>Better tools for adding materials to the database.</li>
  <li>I would be nice to finish off the 3D device model, so irregular shaped contacts could be added.</li>
  <li>Simplified 3D diode models so that panels can be modelled.</li>
  <li>Any other features you can imagine......</li>

</ul>
